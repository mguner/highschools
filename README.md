# Data



# TODOs

1. Clone the repo to your own machine. 
2. Create a folder and name is 'data'
3. Under 'data' folder create two subfolders 'raw' and 'interim'
4. After you clone the repo make sure that you download the link given below and unzip the file. Then without making any changes replace this data under 'data/raw' folder. [CRDC DATA](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/assets/ocr/docs/2017-18-crdc-data.zip)
5. Under the notebooks, I added two notebooks and in them you will find todos until our next meeting.
